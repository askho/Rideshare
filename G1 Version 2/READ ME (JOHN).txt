I got the javascript working for the sign up page along with
other intro pages. The only things i didn't know how to do was
user friendly feed back with having no alert boxes and colored
outlines around the boxes that are missing info (He never taught
us how to do that). And i don't know how to work around the map
javascript on the posting page. I'll try and work on it tonight
but im just giving you this so you have something of mine for 
the javascript. If I make any more progress I will keep posting
this in updates. But for now this is what i got done.
